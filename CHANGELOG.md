# Change log for DscResource.Tests

## Unreleased

- Fixes issue where Reset-DSC causes a Warning to be logged if a DSC
  configuration is not currently running.
- Added issue templates.
- Added the ability to temporary skip common test for debugging purposes
  ([issue #219](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/219)).
- Added functionality to Install-ModuleFromPowerShellGallery helper function to allow using Nuget.exe
  when it is already installed in the temp path. Addresses ([issue #301](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/301)).
- Updated Unit tests to reflect the changes to the Install-ModuleFromPowerShellGallery helper function
- Added a RequiredVersion for PSPKI (v3.3.0.0) in TestHelper because of a critical
  issue in the recently released version (v3.4.0.1) of that module.
- Improved Wiki documentation generation to address more example file types
  and increased unit test coverage and function ([issue #256](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/256)).
- Added .gitignore file and suppressed ```package-lock.json``` file from being
  included in repo.
- Changes to AppVeyor.psm1
  - Updated Invoke-AppveyorInstallTask to provide better informational messages
    when installing each prerequisite

  - Added unit tests for Invoke-AppveyorInstallTask.
- Changes to TestHelper.psm1
  - Updated `Install-NuGetExe` to have a new parameter `RequiredVersion`.
    Also, the `Uri` parameter no longer takes the entire download URL but
    just the URI, i.e. `https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline`. The
    correct download URL is now concatenated withing the helper function.
- Now outputs a warning when a repository does not have a Tests folder
  ([issue #296](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/296)).
- Update PSSA rule Measure-IfStatement to handle when there is a clause spanning
  multiple rows and the first rows ends correctly with an open brace (see example
  in the regression test for this issue)
  ([issue #238](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/238)).
- Update call to install PowerShellGet via Install-Module in AppVeyor.psm1 to
  use AllowClobber
  ([issue #310](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/310)).
- Fix MetaFixers Functions Pipeline Processing.
- Added common opt-in tests for localization ([issue #145](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/145)).
  - Should have an en-US localization folder.
  - The en-US localization folder should have the correct casing.
  - A resource file with the correct name should exist in the localization
    folder.
  - The resource or module should use all the localization string keys
    from the localization resource file.
  - The localization resource file should not be missing any localization
    string key that is used in the resource or module.
  - If there are other localization folders (other than en-US)
    - They should contain a resource file with the correct name.
    - The folders should use the correct casing.
    - All en-US resource file localized string keys must also exist in
      the resource file.
    - There should be no additional localized string keys in the resource
      file that do not exist in the en-US resource file.
- Added `Publish-WikiContent` helper function to publish auto-generated Wiki files
  to the relevant DSC resource GitHub Wiki ([issue #142](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/142)).
- Update New-DscResourcePowerShellHelp to optionally output the PowerShell help files to
  the resource specific path and fix the example processing.
- Added processing to `Test-PublishMetaData` for the InvalidGUID error from Test-ScriptFileInfo
  ([issue #330](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/330)).

- Changed markdown lint rule MD029 to use the 'one' style for ordered lists (issue #115).
- Removed the reference to the function ConvertTo-SpaceIndentation from the warning
  message in the test that checks for tabs in module files. The function
  ConvertTo-SpaceIndentation does not exist anymore ([issue #4](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/4)).
- Removed Byte Order Mark (BOM) from the module file TestRunner.psm1.
- Updated so that checking for Byte Order Mark (BOM) in markdown file lists the

- Added `Get-ResourceModulesInConfiguration` to `TestHelper.psm1` to get support installing
  DSC Resource modules when testing examples.
- Enable 'Common Tests - Validate Example Files' to install missing required modules if
  running in AppVeyor or show warning if run by user.
- Added new common test so that script files (.ps1) are checked for Byte Order
  Mark (BOM) ([issue #160](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/160)).
  This test is opt-in using .MetaTestOptIn.json.
- Added minimum viable product for applying custom PS Script Analyzer rules to
  check adherence to DSC Resource Kit style guidelines
  ([issue #86](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/86)).
  The current rules checks the [Parameter()] attribute format is correct in all parameter blocks.
  - Fixed Byte Order Mark (BOM) in files; DscResource.AnalyzerRules.psd1,
  DscResource.AnalyzerRules.psm1 and en-US/DscResource.AnalyzerRules.psd1
  ([issue #169](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/169)).
  - Extended the parameter custom rule to also validate the Mandatory attribute.
- Fixed so that code coverage can be scan for code even if there is no DSCResource
  folder.
- Added workaround for AppVeyor replaces punctuation in folder structure for
  DscResource.Tests.
- Remove the $repoName variable and replace it with $moduleName as it was a
  duplicate.

  ([issue #170](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/170)).
- Change README.md to resolve lint error MD029 and MD036.
- Added module manifest for manifest common tests to pass.
- Added status badges to README.md.
- Fixed the markdown test so that node_modules can be deleted when path contains
  an apostrophe ([issue #166](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/166)).
  - Fixed typo in It-blocks when uninstalling dependencies.
- Code was moved from the example tests into a new helper function Install-DependentModule
  ([issue #168](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/168)).
  Also fixed bug with Version, where Install-Module would not use the correct
  variable for splatting.
- Enable so that missing required modules for integration tests is installed if
  running in AppVeyor or show warning if run by user ([issue #168](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/168)).
- Set registry key HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\PowerShell\DisablePromptToUpdateHelp
  to 1 when running in AppVeyor to suppress warning caused by running custom rules
  in PSScriptAnalyzer in the GetExternalRule() method of `Engine/ScriptAnalyzer.cs`
  ([issue #176](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/176)).
- Added unit tests for helper function Start-DscResourceTests.
- Updated AppVeyor code so that common tests and unit tests is run on the working
  branch's tests. This is to be able to test changes to tests in pull requests
  without having to merge the pull request before seeing the result.
- Add opt-in parameter RunTestInOrder for the helper function Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask
  which enables running integration tests in order ([issue #184](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/184)).
  - Refactored the class IntegrationTest to be a public sealed class and using
    a named property for OrderNumber
    ([issue #191](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/191)).
- Add Script Analyzer custom rule to test functions and statements so that
  opening braces are set according to the style guideline ([issue #27](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/27)).
- When common tests are running on another repository than DscResource.Tests the
  DscResource.Tests unit and integration tests are removed from the list of tests
  to run ([issue #189](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/189)).
- Fix ModuleVersion number value inserted into manifest in NuGet package produced
  in Invoke-AppveyorAfterTestTask ([issue #193](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/193)).
- Fix TestRunner.Tests.ps1 to make compatible with Pester 4.0.7 ([issue #196](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/196)).
- Improved WikiPages.psm1 to include the EmbeddedInstance to the datatype in the
  generated wiki page ([issue #201](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/201))
- Added basic support for analyzing TypeDefinitionAst related code e.g. Enum & Class definitions to include
  Basic Brace newline rules
  - Created new unit tests to validate the Analyzer rules pass or fail as expected for these new rules
- Added Test-IsClass Cmdlet to determine if particular Ast objects are members of a Class or not
  - Created new Unit Tests to validate the functionality of said cmdlet
- Modified current Parameter, and AttributeArgument Analyzer Rules to check for Class membership and properly validate in those cases as well as the current Function based Cmdlets
  - Created new unit tests to validate the new Analyzer rules pass or fail as expected for Class based resources
- Minor code cleanup in AppVeyor.psm1.
- Updated documentation in README.md and comment-based help in TestHelp.psm1 to
  use the new name of the renamed SqlServerDsc resource module.
- Fixed minor typo in manifest for the CodeCoverage module.
- Added a wrapper Set-PSModulePath for setting $env:PSModulePath to be able to
  write unit tests for the helper functions with more code coverage.
- Minor typos and cleanup in helper functions.
- Fixed a bug in Install-DependentModule when calling the helper function using
  a specific version to install. Now Get-Module will no longer throw an error
  that it does not have a parameter named 'Version'.
- Added unit test for helper function in TestHelper to increase code coverage.
- Added Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask cmdlet functionality for CodeCoverage for Class based resources ([issue #173](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/173))
- Add opt-in parameter RunInContainer for the helper function Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask
  which enables running unit tests in a Docker Windows container. The RunInContainer
  parameter can only be used when the parameter RunTestInOrder is also used.
- Moved helper function Write-Info to the TestHelpers module so it could be reused
  by other modules. The string was changed to output 'UTC' before the time to
  clarify that it is UTC time, and optional parameter 'ForegroundColor' was added
  so that it is possible to change the color of the text that is written.
- Added module DscResource.Container which contain logic to handle the container
  testing when unit tests are run in a Docker Windows container.
- Added Get-OptInStatus function to enable retrieving of an opt-in status
  by name. This is required for implementation of PS Script Analyzer opt-in rules
  where the describe block contains multiple opt-ins in a single block.
- Added new opt-in flags to allow enforcement of script analyzer rules ([issue #161](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/161))
- Updated year in DscResources.Tests.psd1 manifest to 2018.
- Fixed bug where common test would throw an error if there were no
  .MetaTestOptIn.json file or it was empty (no opt-ins).
- Added more tests for custom PS Script Analyzer rules to increased code coverage.
  These new tests call the Measure-functions directly.
- Changed so that DscResource.Tests repository can analyze code coverage for the
  helper modules ([issue #208](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/208)).
- Importing of the TestHelper.psm1 module is now done at the top of the script of
  AppVeyor.psm1. Previously it was imported in each helper function. This was done
  to make it easier to mock the helper functions inside the TestHelper.psm1 module
  when testing AppVeyor.psm1.
- Changed Get-PSModulePathItem to trim end back slash ([issue #217](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/217))
- Updated to support running unit tests on PowerShell Core:
  - Updated helper function Test-FileHasByteOrderMark to use `AsByteStream`.
  - Install-PackageProvider will only run if `Find-PackageProvider -Name 'NuGet'`
    returns a package. Currently it is not found on the AppVeyor build worker for
    PowerShell Core.
  - Adding tests to AppVeyor test pane is done by using the RestAPI because the
    cmdlet Add-AppveyorTest is not supported on PowerShell Core yet.
  - All Push-AppveyorArtifact has been changed to use the helper function
    Push-TestArtifact instead.
  - The helper function Push-TestArtifact uses 'appveyor.exe' to upload
    artifacts because the cmdlet Push-AppveyorArtifact is not supported on
    PowerShell Core.
- Fix codecov no longer generates an error message when uploading test coverage
  ([issue #203](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/203)).
- Added new helper function Get-DscTestContainerInformation to read the container
  information in a particular PowerShell script test file (.Tests.ps1).
- BREAKING CHANGE: For those repositories that are using parameter `RunTestInOrder`
  for the helper function `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask` the
  decoration `[Microsoft.DscResourceKit.IntegrationTest(OrderNumber = 1)]` need
  to move from the configuration file to the test file. This was done since unit
  tests do not have configuration files, and also to align the ability to
  define the order and the container information using the same decoration.
  It is also natural to have the decoration in the test files since those are
  the scripts that are actually run in order.
- BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter `RunInDocker` is removed in helper function
  `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask`. Using parameter `RunTestInOrder` will now
  handle running tests in a container, but only if at least on test is decorated
  using `[Microsoft.DscResourceKit.IntegrationTest()]` or
  `[Microsoft.DscResourceKit.UnitTest()]`, together with the correct named arguments.
- Added support for the default shared module to run unit test and integration test
  in a container by decorating each test file with either
  `[Microsoft.DscResourceKit.IntegrationTest()]` or
  `[Microsoft.DscResourceKit.UnitTest()]`.
- DcsResource.Container
  - Now has support for verifying if image, with or without
    a tag, exists locally or needs to be pulled from Docker Hub.
  - Now shows the correct localized message when downloading
    an image.
  - If 'latest' tag is used on the image name, 'docker pull' will be called to
    make sure the local revision of 'latest' is actually the latest revision on
    Docker Hub. If it isn't, then the latest image will be pulled from Docker Hub.
- Updated AppVeyor.Tests
  - Mock for Resolve-CoverageInfo was removed since it was not used.
  - Moved importing of DscResource.CodeCoverage module to top of AppVeyor.psm1
    for easier mocking.
- Codecov is once again uploaded for "Harness"-model resource modules
  ([issue #229](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/229)).
- Changed Example common test
  - Added support for examples to have mandatory parameters.
  - Added support for all credential parameters, regardless of parameter name.
  - Added support to use the same name both for filename and configuration name.
    Supporting filenames starting with or without a numeric value and a dash,
    e.g '99-MyExample.ps1', or 'MyExample.ps'. Any filename starting with a
    numeric value followed by a dash will be removed. This is to support
    configurations to be able to compile in Azure Automation, but still support
    auto-documentation.
- Add support for publishing examples configurations to PowerShell Gallery if
  opt-in ([issue #234](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/234)).
- Added new opt-in common test 'Common Tests - Validate Example Files To Be Published'.
  This common test verifies that the examples those name ending with '*Config'
  passes testing of script meta data, and that there are no duplicate GUIDs in
  the script meta data (within the examples in the repository).
- Fix bug in `Invoke-AppveyorAfterTestTask` to prevent Wiki generation function
  from getting documentation files from variable `$MainModulePath` defined in
  AppVeyor.yml ([issue #245](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/245)).
- Added support for example and integration test configurations compilation using
  a certificate, so that there are no more need for PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword
  in configurations ([issue #240](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/240)).
- Refactored `WikiPages.psm1` to meet guidelines and improve testability.
- Added unit test coverage for `WikiPages.psm1`.
- Added support to Wiki generation for Example files that are formatted in the
  way required by the automatic example publishing code ([issue #247](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/247)).
- Added `.gitattributes` to force EOL to be CRLF to make testing more consistent
  in unit tests.
- Make sure the latest PowerShellGet is installed on the AppVeyor Build Worker
  ([issue #252](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/252)).
- Update the example publishing example to not use `.EXTERNALMODULEDEPENDENCIES`
  (only #Requires is needed). `.EXTERNALMODULEDEPENDENCIES` is used for external
  dependencies (outside of PowerShell Gallery).
- Example publishing can now use a filename without number prefix
  ([issue #254](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/254)).
- Update `New-DscSelfSignedCertificate` to set environment variables even if
  certificate already exists.
- Change `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask` to also create a self-signed certificate
  using `New-DscSelfSignedCertificate` so that the certificate environment variables
  are still assigned if the test machine reboots after calling
  `Invoke-AppveyorInstallTask` ([issue #255](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/255)).
- Change `New-DscSelfSignedCertificate` to write information about certificate
  creation or usage so that `Invoke-AppveyorInstallTask` and
  `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask` does not have to ([issue #259](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/259)).
- Remove option to use CustomTaskModulePath. It was not used, nor documented. To
  make the unit tests easier the option was removed
  ([issue #263](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/263)).
- Improved the unit tests for the helper function `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask`,
  adding more test coverage, especially for the container part.
- Moved the import of module DscResource.Container to the top of the module file
  AppVeyor.psm1 to simplify the unit tests.
- Rearranging the `Import-Module` and the comment-based help, in the module file
  AppVeyor.psm1, so that the comment-based help is at the top of the file.
- Fix informational message when publishing examples
  ([issue #261](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/261)).
- When cloning this repo and checking out the dev branch, the file
  DscResource.AnalyzerRules.Tests.ps1 was always unstaged. This was probably
  due to the .gitattributes file that was introduced in a previous PR.
  EOL in DscResource.AnalyzerRules.Tests.ps1 is now fixed.
- Adding regression tests for
  [issue #70](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/70)).
- Migrate Pester Test Syntax from v3 -> v4
  ([issue #199](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/199)).
- Activate GitHub App Review Me.
- Removed the default values of the parameter `ExcludeTag` in favor of using
  opt-in. Default is that those tests are opt-out, and must be opt-in
  ([issue #274](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/274)).
- Excluding tag 'Examples' when calling `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask` since
  this repository will never have examples.
- Added Rule Name to PS Script Analyzer custom rules.
- Added PS Script Analyzer Rule Name to Write-Warning output in meta.tests.
- Removed sections 'Goals' and 'Git and Unicode' as they have become redundant
  ([issue #282](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/282)).
- Add a new parameter `-CodeCoveragePath` in the function
  `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask` to be able to add one or more relative
  paths which will be searched for PowerShell modules files (.psm1) to be used
  for evaluating code coverage
  ([issue #114](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/114)).
- The Modules folder, in the resource module root path, was added as a
  default path to be searched for PowerShell modules files (.psm1) to be
  used for evaluating code coverage.
- Added a pull request template as PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md that will be shown
  to the contributor when a pull requests are sent in.
- Added a common tests to test the length of the relative file path so the paths
  are not exceeding the current path hard limit in Azure Automation
  ([issue #188](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/188)).
- Add new opt-in common test for markdown link linting
  ([issue #211](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/211)).
- Adding opt-in common test for spellchecking markdown files. Opt-in by
  adding "Common Tests - Spellcheck Markdown Files" in the file
  .MetaTestOptIn.json ([issue #211](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/211)).
- Opt-in for the test "Common Tests - Spellcheck Markdown Files", and added the
  settings file `.vscode\cSpell.json`.
- Move section Phased Meta test Opt-In in the README.md, and renamed it to
  Common Meta test Opt-In ([issue #281](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/281)).
- Move the change log from README.md to CHANGELOG.md
  ([issue #284](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/284)).
- Opt-in to the common test ([issue #287](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/287)).
  - Common Tests - Relative Path Length
  - Common Tests - Validate Markdown Links
- Change the section "PowerShell Gallery API key" in README.md to to use
  `.gitattributes` file instead of `git config --global core.autocrlf true`
  ([issue #280](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/280)).
